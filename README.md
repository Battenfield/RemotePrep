##Work

###myMethods
is a collection of native JavaScript methods that I have wrote from scratch.

###[WebVR_VirtualMovies](http://battenfield.github.io/lobster-bliss/)
is the final group project where five of us were to manipulate API data with higher order functions.  We choose to venture into the world of WebVR and build an virtual webstore using A-Frame.js  We used a movie API to collect posters, titles, synopsis, genres, and more. We dynamically appended the posters along with their data to the virtually space in rows of genre.  The user can move through the virtual space by selecting our rotational category navigation.

###movie_webstore_hackathon
is the second hackathon of our class which took place week 3 day 1.  We were to build a store website using our knowledge of functions and data structures in 2.5 hours.  We completed our task dynamically appending divs of our products using jQuery.


###super_dungeon_rpg_hackathon
is the first hackathon of our class which took place week 2 day 1.  We were to showcase our jQuery skills on a website of our choice in about 2.5 hours.  We built a text adventure rpg with hitpoints that would have different final outcomes depending on which decisions the user made.
